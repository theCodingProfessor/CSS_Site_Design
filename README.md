# CSS_Site_Design

This site is provided as a demonstration of a progressive build (including an initial creation, multiple prototypes, and a final design) of styling a simple HTML-5 website with CSS. The topic of this website is 'How to Style a Website using CSS.'  

The individual folders of this project each contain a different build of the site, and the directory names indicate which version or stage of the project files are provided. With this in mind any on-screen element from the nav bar to content and topic pages (names and content) will likely be different from one folder to the next. 

Resources in these folders typically include HTML/CSS/JavaScript and links to external sources (Mozilla.org, W3C.org, W3Schoools.com and GetBootstrap.com), as well as external font libraries and icon libraries. 

This project is provided as a demonstration and source code repository intended to be used by the CSS Web design class, and no warranty is provided that this repository will ever be updated or maintained in any way. 

This project is provided as a public repository using an open-source MIT License, and was created using JetBrains Web Storm Integrated Development Environment Software running the full Educational Licence.
