How to Style an HTML-5 website using Modern CSS principles.<br/>
The purpose of this site is to provide a practical, working demonstration of using CSS in a modern website.<br/>
Each page on this website will demonstrate a different CSS styling technique. These demonstrations will include a basic description of the technique, a sample of the code being demonstrated (the css and the html), and provide an illustration (i.e., before and after) of the html element which has been styled.<br/>
Pages which demonstrate larger topic like responsive web design, and page layout techniques may use other tactics to explain the topic, so as not to interfere with the overall site functionality.<br/>
